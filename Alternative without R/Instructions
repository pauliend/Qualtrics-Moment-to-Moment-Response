### Option without R.
In the easier, but less foolproof option, you'll have to assign all your "sliderData_" variables in the survey flow. You'll do this by adding the second to sliderData, resulting in sliderData_1, sliderData_2, and so forth for every second you want to capture. 
You'll also need to **define all the variables of the seconds you want to capture the data for**; If you don't define all these variables, you won't record their data. In my specific use case, the reason I wanted to make this code, I want to capture everyone's data per second, as this allows a full second-by-second analysis and captures different flows of responding per participant (some may report changes often, some may not). This is interesting information for me and that's why all this data will be captured and recorded. 

#### Where Do I Put The Code? 

In the survey builder, you'll select the slider question and scroll down the left-hand menu of that question. At the bottom, you'll see an option to add Javascript:

Click on that, and then delete everything that's there and replace it with the code below. Click save! 

All that's left to do is publish your survey! Good luck. 

##### The Javascript Code

    //
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() {
     // Set up the slider element
    var slider = jQuery("#" + this.questionId + " .ResultsInput");

    // Set up the interval to capture the slider value every second
    var interval = setInterval(function() {
       saveSliderValue();
    }, 1000);

    // Set up the variables for the slider data
    var sliderDataCount = 0;
    var sliderData = {};

    // Define a function to save the slider value to an embedded data field
    function saveSliderValue() {
      // Get the current value of the slider
      var value = slider.val();

    // Save the slider value to an embedded data field
    var variableName = "sliderData_" + sliderDataCount;
    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(variableName, value);

    // Add the slider value to the slider data object
    sliderData[sliderDataCount] = value;

    // Increment the count variable
    sliderDataCount++;
      }

     // Save the number of seconds captured as an embedded data variable on survey submission
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() {
        clearInterval(interval);
       Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData("sliderDataSeconds", sliderDataCount);
          });
       });
